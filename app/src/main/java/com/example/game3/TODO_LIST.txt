STEPS TO IMPLEMENT RANDOM GENERATION OF GALAXIES:

1. figure out where the draw method should be called (Manager) DONE

2. roughly implement manager DONE

Intermittent Step: Implement the methods and properties needed in Galaxy:
    - getWidth
    - getHeight
    - validity boolean (checks if it should be on the screen or not: 2 factors: pressed and time)
DONE DONE DONE DONE

Intermittent Step #2: Implement the empty methods in HyperManager
    - createGalaxies
    - draw
    - update
DONE, DONE, DONE

Intermittent Step #: Implement onTouch for Galaxy with new implementation:
    - create and implement withinBounds
    - implement onTouch in HyperView
DONE, DONE

Intermittent Step # 4: Create Galaxy subclasses:
    - Galaxy (Regular)
    - WormHole
    - BlackHole
DONE DONE DONE


3. use random generation to randomly generate galaxies at different times DONE

4. figure out how to add a timer to each galaxy DONE

5. Add backgrounds:
        - game
        - instructions page
        - game over
DONE DONE DONE
