Added Game3Activity, which handles all activities that occur on screen.

Added Game3View, which handles everything that is drawn onto the screen.

Added Game3Thread, which runs in parallel to be able to update graphics on screen.

Added BlackHole, a testing class that represents a potential image file that will be used
within the game as interactable objects.

Added Game3Manager, which will deal with scoring in the game.

Added Game3_changelog to detail the changes done to the code.

######################
Oct 27 - 10:44 PM - Rajvi

Added an ArrayList in Game3View to keep track of all objects that will be randomly appearing on the
screen. (currently only holds a single BlackHole object for testing purposes).

Added a getWidth() and getHeight() method in BlackHole.

In draw method of Game3View, changed the implementation of drawing object on the screen into a for
loop that loops over the galaxies ArrayList.

Overrode the onTouch method from SurfaceView in Game3View to keep track of MotionEvent instances:
    - when the screen is tapped and the tap falls on an object, remove the object from galaxies

Changed BlackHole class' name to Galaxy.

########################

Modified GameView so that the screen is now split into four rectangles, each representing a place
the player can tap. When a part of the screen is tapped, the corresponding galaxy disappears from
the screen.

#######################
Oct 29 - 6:46 PM - Rajvi

Added javadoc for instance variables and methods in Galaxy. Removed unused ImageView import in
Galaxy.

#######################
Oct 29 - 7:42 PM - Rajvi

Changed the names of Game3Manager to HyperManager. Changed Game3View to HyperView. Changed
width in HyperView to screenWidth. Changed height in HyperView to screenHeight.

#######################
Oct 29 - 8:03 PM - Rajvi

Implemented a rough template of HyperManager, and added an instance of it to the HyperView class.

######################
Oct 29 - 8:19 PM - Rajvi

Added an instance variable, visible, to Galaxy. true when the galaxy instance can appear on the screen, and
false when cannot appear on the screen. also added getter and setter methods for the variable.

######################
Oct 29 - 9:52 PM - Rajvi

Implemented createGalaxies method by moving the code that created the galaxies in view into
this method. as a consequence, removed the galaxies array from HyperView into HyperManager.
Also implemented the draw method in HyperManager. Changed the draw method in HyperView accordingly.

#######################
Oct 29 - 11:46 PM - Rajvi

Changed the onTouch implementation so that it calls the updateGalaxies() method to check if
the tap is within the bounds of a galaxy. removed the visible attribute of Galaxy because it was
unnecessary and redundant.

#######################
Oct 30 - 12:13 AM - Yichen

Added a new instance variable in galaxy that determines its visibility on the display surface.

Added and implemented two methods, checkForDelete(), which randomly generates a number that
determines whether or not the galaxy should be removed from the display screen (independent of user
tapping). getVisibilityStatus() returns the boolean representing the visibility status of the
galaxy. Implemented update() in galaxy to both checkForDelete() and return the value that has been
assigned to it. The program has 5 in 100 chance of deciding that the galaxy must be removed from
the display surface.

Implemented update() in HyperManager to have a 1 in 10 chance in calling update on galaxy and
potentially removing it from the display surface.

#######################
Oct 30 - 12:46 AM - Yichen

Added and implemented new method called createNewGalaxies(), which will randomly check and generate
new galaxies in different positions across the screen.

#######################
Oct 30 - 6:40 PM - Yichen

Added new activity, GameOverActivity, that appears after the game is finished, showing the player's
score. Updated Game3Activity to accommodate a restricted game time, which runs on a separate thread.
Updated HyperManager to store and return total score gained by the player. Updated Galaxy to
randomly generate a score from 100 to 200 inclusive, which is the score gained by the player should
they tap the galaxy.

Renamed scratch.txt to TODO_LIST.txt.

#######################
Oct 30 - 6:42 PM - Yichen

Added two new galaxy types, Blackhole and Wormhole. Blackhole will remove points from the total
amount of points the player has gained, and Wormhole will give double the normal amount of points
if tapped.

#######################
Oct 30 - 7:50 PM - Yichen

Updated HyperManager so that it no longer creates new Galaxy objects, and outsourced it to the
class GalaxyFactory. Updated HyperManager and HyperView to accommodate these changes.

Added new pictures for galaxies. Updated random-generation of galaxies to include random picking of
galaxy appearances, from a list of 5 potential appearances.

#######################
Oct 30 - 8:13 PM - Yichen

Updated GalaxyFactory so that the galaxies will not spawn off-screen.

#######################

the player back to InstructionActivity.
