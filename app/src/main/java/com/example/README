Play the game in order by clicking the "Next Game" button as instructed, starting with Game 1:
Maze of Doom.

The game should start up by simply clicking the run button.

Whenever you make a new virtual device, sign up first!

Collect artifacts for bonus points!
In Maze of Doom they are white circles (aka "metal plating to build the spaceship")
In Flappy Asteroids they are galaxies that you must observe and collect data from to find
extraterrestrial planets!
In Galactic Hyperjump, travel to new planets!

INSTRUCTIONS FOR GAME 3: GALAXY HYPERJUMP:
1. Level 1: Tap all galaxies except for the black hole (turquoise aura emanating from a dark centre)
2. Level 2: Tap all galaxies that match the colour provided. Avoid black holes.
3. Level 3: Tap all galaxies that match the colour provided. Colour will change throughout the game.

Extra Note: Wormholes look just like black holes but with an aqua hue! Tapping wormholes will
reduce a life but will give extra points! Black holes will simply reduce a life and points.
